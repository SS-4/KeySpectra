# KeySpectra: Keylogger Demonstration - JavaScript

### Maintainer: [Sam Samie](https://github.com/SS-4)

**Disclaimer:** This repository, KeySpectra, is meant for educational and demonstration purposes only. The contained code represents a simple keylogger, a tool that is often used for malicious purposes. Please do not use this code to violate privacy or laws. Using this code for malicious purposes is against the law and strictly forbidden. 

**Description:**

KeySpectra is a JavaScript code demonstrating a basic keylogger. A keylogger is a type of surveillance technology used to monitor and record each keystroke typed on a specific computer's keyboard. Keyloggers are often used in IT organizations to troubleshoot technical problems with computers and business networks. However, they also have a darker side, as they can be used for illegal activities.

**How it Works:**

KeySpectra captures keystrokes and then sends the data to a predefined server after encrypting it. The encryption and data transmission processes are abstracted for the sake of brevity.

**How to Use:**

KeySpectra can be embedded in a web page to demonstrate how a simple keylogger works. Please ensure that you have proper authorization before embedding this code in any live environment, as it could potentially capture sensitive information.
